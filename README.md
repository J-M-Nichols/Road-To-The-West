4. Event
5. Completion
6. Initial Resources

### Resources
- Food
- Preserved Food
- Cattle
- Tools
- Settlers
- Wagons

#### Food
A certain amount of food is used each day. The amount will be 1 food per settler per day. Food will expire after 3 days. Food can be preserved while gathering resources.

#### Preserved Food
While gathering food, 500 food can be preserved. Preserved food can last around 45 days.

#### Cattle
Cattle can be converted into food while gathering resources. A single cattle would produce 2,000 food. Cattle can be obtained by trading tools, or found during events. 1 settler is needed to manage 1 cattle.

#### Tools
Tools can be used to maintain wagons while gathering resources. Tools can be obtained by trading cattle, or found during events. Between 25-75 tools can be used to save a wagon if it is lost by anything other than a lack of cattle.

#### Settlers
As long as you have a single settler, you can continue playing the game. 1 settler and 1 cattle are needed to move 1 wagon. A single settler can hold 500 food or 25 tools.

#### Wagons
A wagon can hold 2,000 food preserved or not or 8 people or 100 tools.

### Travel
- Move forward
- Chance of events

#### Move Forward
The caravan can travel 30-40 miles per day. If there are no wagons, the caravan can travel 10-20 miles per day.

#### Chance of events
Each day of travel has a 40% chance of a random event.

### Events
- River crossing : 5% chance of loss for each resource
- Illness : 5% chance of loss for each settler
- Encounter with Native Americans (50% chance of a loss of 10% of each resource)
- Encounter with other settlers (trade options)
    - Trade 50-150 food per settler : 3-5 settlers available
    - 25% chance to have the whole caravan with 5-15% starting resources added to the players caravan
- Encounter cattle : can accept 1-5 cattle, min 1
- Rain : 2-4 days : movement speed decreased by 20%
- Heat wave : 2-4 days : food decays 20% faster

### Seasons
    - Summer
        - 15% chance of Heat Wave : 2-4 days : food decays 20% faster
        - 20% increase in encounters with settlers and Native Americans and cattle
        - 10% decrease in chance of illness
        - 10% decrease in chance of rain
    - Fall/Autumn
        - 10% increase in encounters with settlers and Native Americans and cattle
        - 5% increase in encounters of rain 
    - Winter
        - 10% Decrease in encounters with settlers and Native Americans and cattle
        - 15% increase in encounters of illness
        - 10% increase in encounters of rain 
    - Spring
        - 5% increase in encounters of rain        
        - 10% increase in encounters with settlers and Native Americans and cattle

### Completion
Travel 3,000 miles with at least 1 settler still alive.

### Initial Resources
- 0 food
- 1,500-2,000 preserved food
- 3-5 cattle
- 10-20 settlers
- 5-8 wagons
- 150-200 tools

The initial resources are based on random chance. A random number from 0-9 is chosen for each resource then that percentage of (n * 0.1) is added to the resource (rounding down). An extra cattle is given for each wagon.

When enountering a settler group, they have 5-15% of initial resources after base being assigned.
