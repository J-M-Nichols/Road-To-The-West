                The goal of <b>Road To The West</b> is to travel 3,000 miles with at least 1 settler still alive. Once you have travelled 3,000 miles you will receive your score based on the total of your current resources reduced by the number of days that you took. If all of your settlers perish then you lose the game and can reset to try again.
            </p>
            <p><b>What is the highest score that you can achieve?</b></p>
